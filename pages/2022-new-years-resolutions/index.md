# 2022 - New Year's Resolutions

<img src="headline.jpg" />

Next year (2022) will be a different year for me. I'm taking a leave of absence from my employer (Agder Energi) for one year.

I'm so fortunate to be part of a small group that have received funding to work on free open-source projects for the coming year.

We'll be working on Web3 technology, with the goal to build a more decentralized and beautiful World Wide Web.

The Internet is an incredible thing, but it's been abused by many, and we've built infrastructure that is fragile and prone to leaks and hacks.

Web3 changes the landscape, instead of you and me being the product for social networks and advertisers, social networks will in the future be more aligned with how they are in real life. We'll own our own identities, and we'll own our own data.

The data we create, should be our data. We should be in control of how and with who we share our data. That is in the spirit of Internet, and it is where we are all going.

I'm so excited to be having this opportunity to work on technology that is going to have an impact of billions of people into the future.

Many of you already know that I'm a believer in kindness, towards humans and animals alike. I think our current way of organizing society, is merely an adaptation of the historical abuse and slavery of humans and animals.

We can do better, and we should do better. We should let people be free. We should let animals be free.

It feels like an incredible blow to my heart thinking about the unfortunate and horrible conditions of life that a lot of people (and animals) still experience on this Earth. It is so clear and obvious to me that we should have gotten rid of these problems long ago, but they perpetuate because weâ€™re all being told little stories from our birth that tells us what to believe.

The state and government tell us those stories, that they are needed to regulate the private market and corporations from exploiting humans and creating horrible conditions on Earth. This is the opposite of reality. The reality is that despite of state and government, the market is able to improve the life and economic status of more and more people every single day.

The problem has never been the market. The problem has always been the crown and the state.

Violence is not the solution, love and peace are. A lot of revolutionaries want to take up guns and fight against other groups with even more guns. The state is the biggest owner and wielder of guns and power. It is the ultimate destroyer of human life. Yet most of you, parade and cherish this religion of statism, unable to see the truth for what it is.

Politicians don't like me, and I don't fancy them either. I've heard many times that people with my ideas should be shut up, because we erode the (blind) trust in states and governments. That's not hyperbole, it's a lived experience.

Back in 1998, the computer scientist Wei Dai revealed "b-money". It was not until 2009 that Satoshi revealed Bitcoin. Bitcoin, blockchains, cryptography, are all very important innovations for humanity to grow and improve.

Here is a quote from what Wei Dai wrote:

"Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word "anarchy", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations."

The government is the largest exploiter of humans and animals, but we should not use violence to get rid of violence. We must build a better future where governments become permanently unnecessary.

I'm going to spend this year building incredible things. I'd love to get your support in my endeavor, and I know it comes with a cost. It's not easy to get rid of existing dogmas and believes. It's emotionally disturbing to wake up and realize how much pain and suffering one is doing towards animals by the consumption of milk, eggs and meat. It is emotionally disturbing to wake up and realize that the state and government is not here to save the world and improve the human condition.

But when you wake up, you'll be so, so happy. You won't be able to stop smiling. You won't be able to stop loving.

Life is a journey, and all I've learnt so far has made my life fantastic and with great hopes for the future. I've met some amazing human beings, and animals, and I hope you too can find your way to a better and more prosperous future with less harm towards humans and animals.

Take care, I'll see you in the future.

Thanks,

Sondre
